				<h2>Not Too Fussed</h2>
				<p>Both ladies have settled in very well, even with the construction next door (they do not seem to be able to hear much of it).</p>
				<p>We embark on a fortnight-long out-of-country trip tomorrow, and we had some anxiety about leaving the cats.</p>
				<p>However, as you can see, Leia does not seem to be too fussed about most things.</p>

				<h2>The Lap Of Luxury</h2>
				<p>I would hazard a guess that Matilda is feeling much more comfortable around us.</p>
				<p>Here she takes a short break from begging for food and seems content with a few strokes.</p>
				<p>So nice to have a lap kitty again!</p>

				<h2>The Cat Is Out Of The Bag</h2>
				<p>Or rather, "The cat is <strong>in</strong> the bag."</p>
				<p>These cat toys have been sitting on the floor in the same place for a fortnight, ignored by both cats. One afternoon, out of the blue, Leia decides she is very interested. Her selection?  String monkey with bells.</p>

				<h2>Much More Matilda</h2>
				<p>Into the second week of The Big Rehoming, and we have seen so much more of Matilda.</p>
				<p>After a tentative start, Matilda now roams and interacts with confidence. Here she is soaking in a little springtime sun and checking out the passersby.</p>
				<p>We discover more about each cat daily as they slowly reveal their personalities. Great fun, much joy!</p>

				<h2>Milk Maid Matilda</h2>
				<p>Our other cats really enjoyed Whiskas cat milk, so we asked Kelly if we should put some out for the fuzzy ladies. She said it would be okay, mentioning that Matilda especially likes it.</p>

				<h2>Straight From The Tin</h2>
				<p>Positive karma was drained the other day when I had to pin down Matilda to brush some dried poo from her bum area.</p>
				<p>In an effort to replenish some good will, I enticed Matilda to eat directly out of the tin.</p>
				<p>Not sure we are 100% back, but she seemed to think it a tasty treat.</p>

				<h2>Cat Cave</h2>
				<p>After being ignored in a couple of previous locations, the cat nests are now occupied nearly full time in their new position underneath the main bed.</p>
				<p>Leia and Matilda spend large portions of the day there. Every couple of hours or so they will prowl out, nibble on a kibble, have a long drink, use the litter tray...and then it is back to the cat cave.</p>
				<p>Sometimes they change which nest they sleep in. Odd.</p>
