<h3 style="text-align: center">ERNA AMANDA UTECH PETERSON</h3>
<h4 style="text-align: center">100 YEARS YOUNG</h4>
<p>
Erna was born on her parents’ farm between Tampa and Ramona, Kansas, on October 20, 1918.  She is the second oldest of William and Marie Utech’s eleven children.  Erna has now had one hundred years of life experiences.
</p>
<p>
As a child growing up on the farm, Erna learned a lot by firsthand experience.  She and her older sister Edna got their start in baking by making cookies when they were very young.  Erna’s chore of doing all the mending was what sparked her interest in sewing.  When she was a little older, she made dresses for her younger sisters out of printed flour sacks.  Erna and her siblings walked to Endeavor, a one-room country school located two and a half miles south of the farm.  She remembers one time when they attempted to clear the lane of drifted snow because they didn’t want to miss school.  Another fond memory is of building a seesaw using a heavy bridge plank which had floated down the creek after a heavy rain.  She and her brother Erich pulled it up the bank.  She especially enjoyed the Fourth of July when they celebrated with homemade ice cream and pop.  The family was very self-sufficient.  They had fruit from the orchard, vegetables from the garden, and fish from the creek.  Their beef, pork, and chicken were all raised on the farm.  They had fresh eggs, milk, and cream, and they churned their own butter.  The cellar was filled with canned goods, potatoes, and watermelons.  Cured meats and preserved meats in crocks of lard were stored in a room upstairs. There was no electricity or running water in the house.  They had a cistern, a well, and a spring.  Cold spring water in a wooden tank down by the creek was used to keep food cold when necessary.  After finishing school, Erna stayed to help on the farm and take care of her younger siblings.  When her brother Fred went to high school in Tampa, she rode with him in the Model A Ford and worked at her uncle Ernest’s general store in town.  The store had a soda fountain and a counter for serving meals.

<p>
In the fall of 1942, Erna and her sister Esther went to Salina to attend Brown-Mackie Business School.  They rented a room in a family home.  They went to classes in the morning and worked at the lunch counter at Duckwalls Variety Store over the lunch hour where they got their noon meals free.  As World War II brought about the opening of many air bases, Erna was able to get a civil service job at the Herington Army Air Field.  She started work there in the spring of 1943.  After two years, she moved to Topeka and worked at Forbes Air Base for another two years.  In 1947, Erna began a job in the accounting department of Southwestern Bell Telephone Company in Topeka.  She was employed there for five years.
</p>
<p>
Erna married Marvin Peterson in 1952.  She first met Marvin at a dance in Topeka.  He was a farmer/stockman from Osage City.  She left her city job and was once again out on a farm, living in an old farmhouse.  When they were going through the process of changing her name and listing property in joint ownership, the lawyer must have noticed something in Erna’s abilities, as he asked her to come to work for him.  She declined, saying she had too much work to do on the farm.  Eventually, Erna wanted to have a new house built on the farm and she designed it herself.  They sold the old house, which was moved to Osage City, and they moved into a vacant house nearby while Erna’s new self-designed house was being built.  She helped with some of the work, painting and sweeping up, and in 1970 she and Marvin moved into their new house.  Erna was a full partner with Marvin in their farming business, growing grain and raising cattle.  Throughout the years, they purchased more and more land until they had acquired a total of 800 acres.  They did very well, as they were able to pay for it all without holding outside jobs.  When Marvin and Erna retired in 1984, they rented out the land but continued to live on the farm.  In their retirement years, they made improvements on the land, building new fences, clearing brush, and building ponds.  Marvin passed away in 1995.
</p>
<p>
For more than twenty years now, Erna has been living alone on the farm and taking care of herself, her home, and her farming business.  She continues to rent out her cultivated land and watches the grain market so she can make decisions as to when to sell her share of the crops.  She rents out her pasture land for cash.  She is in good health except for her failing eyesight.  For this reason, she had to give up driving about four years ago.  It was hard for her to lose this part of her independence, but she is very thankful for her many good friends and neighbors who provide her transportation to church, shopping, and errands.

	<p>
	ANOTHER EXCITING DAY AT THE PETERSON RANCH.<br />
	ERNA IS THE OLDEST OF WHAT’S LEFT OF THE UTECH BRANCH.<br />
	</p>
	<p>
	STARTED BAKING WHEN SHE WAS EIGHT OR NINE.<br />
	STILL BAKES BREAD TODAY, AND IT TURNS OUT FINE.<br />
	</p>
	<p>
	THE SECOND OLDEST OF A BROOD OF ELEVEN.<br />
	STUDIES HER BIBLE, AND IS ON HER WAY TO HEAVEN.<br />
	</p>
	<p>
	SHE IS ONE OF THE THREE OLDEST, WHO NEVER WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL.<br />
	HELPING YOUNGER SIBLINGS WITH THEIR HOMEWORK WAS HER LEARNING TOOL.<br />
	</p>
	<p>
	ERNA CAN WORK AS HARD AS ANY MAN, SAID DAD.<br />
	NOW THAT'S ANOTHER DAUGHTER I'M GLAD I HAD.<br />
	</p>
	<p>
	NOW ERNA WAS REALLY GOOD AT SHOCKING WHEAT,<br />
	WHILE EDNA WAS ONLY THERE TO SEE HOW MANY NEIGHBOR BOYS SHE COULD MEET.<br />
	</p>
	<p>
	COULD YOU USE SOME HELP, ASKED DAD, AS SHE LEFT THE NEST.<br />
	I'D LIKE TO MAKE IT ON MY OWN, I THINK THAT'S BEST.<br />
	</p>
	<p>
	SO OFF TO A SMALL BUSINESS  SCHOOL SHE WOULD GO,<br />
	WITH HER YOUNGER SISTER, ESTHER, IN TOW.<br />
	</p>
	<p>
	ON THIS ONE THING THEY WOULD ALWAYS AGREE.<br />
	WITHOUT ERNA'S HELP, SHE WOULD NOT HAVE GOTTEN HER DEGREE.<br />
	</p>
	<p>
	ERNA WAS BLESSED WITH A GOOD HUSBAND, EVERYONE KNEW HIM AS PETE.<br />
	YOU'D HAVE TO LOOK FAR AND WIDE TO FIND SOMEONE WHO COULD EVEN COMPETE.<br />
	</p>
	<p>
	THEY STARTED OUT ON THE FARM WITH VERY LITTLE,<br />
	BUT IT DID'NT TAKE HER LONG TO SOLVE THAT RIDDLE.<br />
	</p>
	<p>
	HARD WORK AND GOOD MANAGEMENT IS OFTEN THE ROAD LESS TAKEN,<br />
	BUT IN THIS CASE, IT REALLY BROUGHT HOME THE BACON.<br />
	</p>
	<p>
	ERNA AND PETE DROVE THE TRACTORS ALL DAY.<br />
	WHEN THE SUN WAS SHINING, THEY WOULD REALLY MAKE HAY.<br />
	ONE THING WAS FOR CERTAIN, THEY ALWAYS EARNED THEIR PAY.<br />
	</p>
	<p>
	ON THEIR RANCH, THEY RAISED CATTLE.<br />
	SO YOU KNOW, PETE SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN THE SADDLE.<br />
	TRUCKING THEIR STEERS TO MARKET, WAS QUITE A BATTLE.<br />
	IN THIS CASE, IT WASN’T ALL HAT AND NO CATTLE.<br />
	</p>
	<p>
	PETE NEVER WORKED ON SUNDAY, AND THAT SUITED HIM JUST FINE.<br />
	IF ONE EVER NEEDED HELP, HE'D ALWAYS FIND THE TIME.<br />
	</p>
	<p>
	SQUARE DANCING KEPT THEIR SOCIAL LIFE ON THE GO.<br />
	ALL HER DRESSES AND HIS SHIRTS, SHE WOULD SEW.<br />
	SHE MADE THEM TO MATCH, IT WAS QUITE A SHOW.<br />
	</p>
	<p>
	ERNA LIKES TO BE CALLED EVERY DAY, TO SEE IF SHE IS OKAY.<br />
	WE WORRIED WHEN WE COULDN'T GET A RESPONSE ONE DAY.<br />
	WE CALLED THE SHERIFF, TO SEE WHAT HE WOULD SAY.<br />
	</p>
	<p>
	ERNA HAS MANY STRONG BELIEFS, WE ALL COULD TAKE TO HEART.<br />
	BUT A LITTLE SOFTER DELIVERY, WOULD TAKE THE EDGE OFF THE DART.<br />
	</p>
	<p>
	AS FOR DOCTORS AND LAWYERS, SHE HAS NO USE.<br />
	THINKS THEY ARE TOO DANGEROUS, TO BE OUT ON THE LOOSE.<br />
	</p>
	<p>
	WHEN IT COMES TO COOKING, IT SHOULD BE DONE FROM SCRATCH.<br />
	FOR HALF THE COST OF THAT PREPARED STUFF, I COULD STIR UP A BATCH.<br />
	</p>
	<p>
	ALL DRINKING SHOULD BE AVOIDED, EVEN WINE.<br />
	IF THE PLACE SELLS IT, DON'T GO THERE TO DINE.<br />
	ON LIQUOR, I NEVER SPENT A DIME.<br />
	</p>
	<p>
	IN MARRIAGE THE WIFE HAS ALL THE POWER.<br />
	SHE CAN EITHER MAKE HIM OR TEAR HIM DOWN.<br />
	IT ALL DEPENDS ON HOW OFTEN SHE GOES TO TOWN.<br />
	</p>
	<p>
	NEED MARRIAGE COUNSELING, KNOW THE WOMAN HOLDS ALL THE CARDS.<br />
	HER ONLY TRICK IS TO MAKE HIM BELIEVE HE’S IN CHARGE.<br />
	</p>
	<p>
	ERNA BELIEVES SPENDING YOUR MONEY WISELY IS A VIRTUE, NOT A VICE.<br />
	WHEN IT COMES TO FINANCES, ALL OF YOU COULD TAKE A LITTLE ADVICE.<br />
	</p>
	<p>
	NOW ERNA LIVES ALONE, AND HAS GROWN OLD.<br />
	TO SEE HOW ACTIVE SHE IS, IS A SIGHT TO BEHOLD.<br />
	SOME SAY SHE COMES OFF A LITTLE BIT BOLD.<br />
	BUT BENEATH IT ALL, LIES A PURE HEART OF GOLD.<br />
	</p>
