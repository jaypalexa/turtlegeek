DB 37:

It's February and you've made it through another year, endured the holidays with extended family and even survived the Great Atlanta Blizzard of 2016. You've got to ask yourself one question; "Do you feel lucky? Well, do ya?" If the answer is yes, then please join us on Sunday February 7, 2016 for Duperbowl XXXVII. Kickoff is set for 12:00 noon so don't be late. As always, it don't cost nuth'n and the beer is free! See you there rain or shine.
