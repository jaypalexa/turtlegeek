Viva La DuperBowl!!

Despite long odds the DuperBowl keeps spinning and is turning thirty-five this year! So deal yourself in, roll the dice and double-down on poor judgment and beer-fueled football. This year we'll be celebrating the thirty-fifth anniversary of the DuperBowl and we're expecting an avalanche of players and fans so sign up early and avoid the rush. 

We're playing at Brookhaven Park again this year & the usual pizza-beer-bull session will follow at Mellow Mushroom. As always, it don't cost nuthin so show up whether you're a player, a fan or your cable went out and you just couldn't find anything better to do.
