     It's inescapable - Just like taxes, bad drivers & gas after Tex-Mex...

				THE DUPER BOWL !!!!

Dust off your cleats and notify your next-of-kin because it's time for fun in the sun or pain in the rain. Regardless of weather, solar flares, locusts or financial cliffs the 34th annual DUPER BOWL will be contested Sunday February 3, 2013 at 12:00 on the hallowed grounds of Brookhaven Park and YOU are invited. 

Football, beer, embarrassment - even debilitating injury...and it's all FREE! You don't even have to play to enjoy the spectacle - be a fan. As always, you are welcome to bring ex-spouses, co-workers, family or anyone else you'd like to alienate.
