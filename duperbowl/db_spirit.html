					<FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial">Once upon a time, a bunch of 
						middle-aged guys - who thought they weren't -
						<BR>
						were sitting around a bar near downtown Saint Louis on the last Sunday
						<BR>
						in January, 1980, waiting for the Big Game to start,
						<BR>
						and one of the smarter ones said, "Why don't we have our own Big Game?"<BR>
						<BR>
						"Well, gee, what would we call it?" asked a gullible one.<BR>
						"This being Super Bowl Sunday, let's call it 'Duper Bowl'!"
						<BR>
						And the legend was born.<BR>
						<BR>
						The spirit of Duper Bowl quite simply put is to enjoy running around playing 
						touch football
						<BR>
						with a bunch of essentially inept players. The game isn't the point.
						<BR>
						The enjoyment of a Sunday afternoon not spent sitting on your ass watching the 
						tube is.
						<BR>
						Serious players always get upset at Duper Bowl because the other players aren't 
						'into it.'
						<BR>
						That's the whole point. If we were into it, we wouldn't be playing in Duper 
						Bowl.
						<BR>
						<BR>
						It is a chance to go out and do something out of your daily routine.
						<BR>
						The necessary pushing and shoving and running around chasing each other is the 
						fun part.
						<BR>
						Getting winded, freezing your ass off, drinking warm beer on a cold day, 
						yelling and
						<BR>
						screaming at each other for the sheer joy of being able to makes it a good 
						thing.<BR>
						<BR>
						Tied to our computers as we are, it becomes more imperative
						<BR>
						to get out, vent, chase, yell, scream, PLAY.<BR>
						<BR>
						It gives a group of loosely-related people a focus, something to talk about,
						<BR>
						a goal and a good time sharing the same stupid things.
						<BR>
						A Duper Bowl buddy is a pal for life. There is a sense of initiation and 
						ritual,
						<BR>
						a mutual feeling of shared danger and excitement.
						<BR>
						We could use a little more of that and a lot less of the pre-manufactured 
						experiences
						<BR>
						so cunningly developed for us by 'Content Providers.'
						<BR>
						<BR>
						<B>Let's make our own memories and our own fun.</B><BR>
